## Installing

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed then fork/clone this repo.
Open it in your terminal of choice and run the command:

```
npm install
```

## Scripts

To see it in action in development mode, run the command:

```
npm start
```

To run the test suite:

```
npm test
```

To compile the production build:

```
npm run build
```

The project is too small for the production build to perform much differently than the development one, but you can run it after it compiles with:

```
npx serve dist
```

## Deployment

You can also just see it live [here](https://gfn-frontend-challenge-vitor-vieira.vercel.app/) in a Vercel deployment.
